              <h4><b>Anticipated Release: Fall 2025</b></h4> 
              <p>Grand Theft Auto VI is one of 2025's most hotly anticipated games, so much so that, despite Rockstar sharing few details about the project, analysts already predict it'll top $3 billion in sales during its first year. Leonida -- Rockstar's version of Miami -- is Grand Theft Auto VI's setting, and it begins as thief and former inmate Lucia celebrates regaining her freedom by deciding to take on one more big job.

                How this fits in with everything else Rockstar showed in GTA VI's first trailer -- the walks down crowded beaches, alligator attacks, penthouse parties and half-naked old men shouting at people walking past -- is anyone's guess at this point. The studio has shared no development updates since December 2023, although it still plans to release the game later in 2025.</p>

              <h4><b>Anticipated Release: Febuary 4th, 2025</b></h4> 
              <p>It's not often a studio gets the chance to make their dream game twice, but Warhorse got lucky. After releasing Kingdom Come: Deliverance in 2018 --a buggy, but captivating historical drama about political unrest in 1400s Bohemia -- Warhorse is launching a sequel with the scope and complexity they originally planned for the first game, including a bigger map, more quests and a deeper story.

                Henry, the orphaned son of a blacksmith, finds himself embroiled in Bohemia's civil war and fighting to bring down Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, but like its predecessor, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is as much about the bizarre, often emotional stories that take place in between major plot points -- like promising to make a healing potion for a village, despite being unable to read complicated books.</p>
